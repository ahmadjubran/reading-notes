# REST

## Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. He helped to create the REST architectural style.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- **HTTP** is the protocol that Fielding and his friends created. It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

- **HTTP** is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

## What does a GET do?

**GET** is a way for you to grab data from a data source with the help of the internet.

## What does a POST do?

**POST** request method requests that a web server accept the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it.

## What does PUT do?

**PUT** request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.

## What does PATCH do?

**PATCH** request a set of modifications in the request entity to be applied for the resource recognized by the Request-URI.
