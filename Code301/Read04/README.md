# React and Forms

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

Controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

we should update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them because it is better for the user to see the changes in the UI as soon as they enter their responses.

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

We can target the event target by using the `.target` property.

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

because it is a cleaner way to write if/else statements.

## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```jsx
if (x === y) {
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

```jsx
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
