# Mongo and Mongoose

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases

| SQL                       | NoSQL                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Relational Databases      | Non-Relational Databases    |
| table based databases     | document based              |
| predefined schema         | dynamic schema              |
| vertically scalable       | horizontally scalable       |
| structured query language | Unstructured Query Language |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.

## Give a real world example

MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL.

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## Give a real world example

MongoDB, CouchDb, Redis

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL database.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL database.

## What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

## What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Relational databases work with tables.

## What is a ‘schema’?

A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects.

## What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

## How does it work?

NoSQL database stores data in key-value pairs, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not require predefined schema.

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why

MongoDB is more flexible because it is a document database and it is not bound by the table structure.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

The disadvantage of NoSQL database is that it does not have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
