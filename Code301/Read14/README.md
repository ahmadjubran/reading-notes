# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

Personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

More men became interested in it and that make them choose computers as a career path.

## When are diversity efforts most successful?

When they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

## Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. For example, When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it and 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
