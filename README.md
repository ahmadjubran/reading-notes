## Ahmad Jubran

Hello everyone,
my name is Ahmad Jubran, I live in Amman, Jordan. I have a bachelors degree in computer engineering from Al-balqa'a applied university. I'm excited for this class because it will help me develop my skills as a web developer. I'm confident that I will be able to learn a lot from it.
