# Readings: Stack and Queues

## What's the difference between Stack and Queue?

| Stack                                                                                                 | Queue                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The stack is based on LIFO(Last In First Out) principle.                                              | The queue is based on FIFO(First In First Out) principle.                                   |
| Insertion Operation is called Push Operation.                                                         | Insertion Operation is called Enqueue Operation.                                            |
| Deletion Operation is called Pop Operation.                                                           | Deletion Operation is called Dequeue Operation.                                             |
| Push and Pop Operation is performed at the same end.                                                  | Enqueue and Dequeue Operation takes place at different end.                                 |
| Simple Implementation                                                                                 | Complex Implementation in comparison to Stack.                                              |
| Only one pointer is used to implement the stack.                                                      | Two pointers are used to implement the queue.                                               |
| The most accessible element is called Top and the least accessible is called the Bottom of the stack. | The insertion end is called Rear End and the deletion end is called the Front End.          |
| Empty condition is checked using ( Top == -1 ).                                                       | Empty condition is checked using ( Front == -1 ).                                           |
| Full condition is checked using ( Top == Max-1 ).                                                     | Full condition is checked using ( Rear == Max-1 ).                                          |
| There are no variants available for stack                                                             | There are three types of variants i.e circular queue, double-ended queue and priority queue |
| Can be considered as a vertical collection visual                                                     | Can be considered as a horizontal collection visual                                         |
| Used to solve the recursive type problems                                                             | Used to solve the problem having sequential processing                                      |

## What is Stacks and how to use it?

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

## What is Queue?

The queue is a linear data structure in which we can insert the element from one side of the list and delete the element from the other side of the list.
