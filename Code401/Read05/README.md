# Socket BE

## The OSI Model

The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

    The OSI model's goal is to provide a standard for the communication between different systems.

- The OSI Model has 7 layers. What are they?

      - Physical
      - Data Link
      - Network
      - Transport
      - Session
      - Presentation
      - Application

- What is the purpose of each layer?

  - Physical: The physical layer is responsible for the physical transmission of the data. This includes the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications of the connection.
  - Data Link: The data link layer is responsible for the transfer of data between two nodes that are directly connected to each other.
  - Network: The network layer is responsible for the transfer of data between two nodes that are not directly connected to each other.
  - Transport: The transport layer is responsible for the transfer of data between two nodes that are not directly connected to each other.
  - Session: The session layer is responsible for the establishment and termination of a session between two nodes.
  - Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for the translation of data between two nodes.
  - Application: The application layer is responsible for the communication between two nodes.

- The difference between TCP/IP model and the OSI model

  The TCP/IP model is a model that is used to describe the functions of Internet protocols. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

## Socket.io

Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

- What is a socket used for?

  Sockets are used for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server.

- What is the difference between socket.io and Web Sockets?

  Web Sockets are a protocol that allows for real-time communication between a client and a server. Socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
