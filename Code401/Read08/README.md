# Graphs

## What is a Graph?

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Types of Graphs

- Finite Graphs - A graph that has a finite number of vertices and edges.
- Infinite Graphs - A graph that has an infinite number of vertices and edges.
- Trivial Graphs - A graph that has no vertices or edges.
- Simple Graphs - A graph that has no self-loops or parallel edges.
- Multi graphs - A graph that has more than one edge between two vertices.
- Null Graph - A graph that has no edges.
- Complete Graph - A graph that has all possible edges.
- Pseudo Graph - A graph that has edges that are not connected to any vertices.
- Regular Graph - A graph that has the same number of edges for every vertex.
- Bipartite Graph - A graph that has two sets of vertices such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.
- Labeled Graph - A graph that has vertices and edges that are labeled.
- Digraph Graph - A graph that has directed edges.
- Subgraph - A graph that is a subset of another graph.
- Connected or Disconnected Graph - A graph that has all vertices connected or not connected.
- Cyclic Graph - A graph that has a cycle.
- Types of Subgraphs - A graph that is a subset of another graph.

## Difference between graph and tree

| The basis of Comparison | Graph                                       | Tree                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Definition              | Graph is a non-linear data structure.       | Tree is a non-linear data structure.        |
| Data Structure          | Graph is a collection of vertices.          | Tree is a collection of nodes.              |
| Edges                   | Each node can have any number of edges.     | Each node can have only one edge.           |
| Types of Edges          | Directed and Undirected                     | All edges are directed.                     |
| Root                    | No root node.                               | Root node is present.                       |
| Loop                    | Loop is possible.                           | Loop is not possible.                       |
| Traversal               | Depth First Search and Breadth First Search | Depth First Search and Breadth First Search |
